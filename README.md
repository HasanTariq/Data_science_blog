# Write a Data Science Blog Post

This is one of the Udacity Data Science Nano-Degree projects. The main objective of this project is to encourage the student to come up with 3 - 5 questions and perform analysis on any dataset of their choice. The student should apply what they learned during the nano degree starting from exploring the data walking through cleaning and massaging the dataset until the analyzing the data and start answering the questions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Project Motivation
The following questions motivate me to do this project:

- What is the most used programming language among developers?
- Which programing language has a positive correlation with high career satisfaction?
- Which platform and IDE are highly popular among the developer?

### File Descriptions

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebooks are exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells & comments were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

survey_result_puplic.csv - This file contains 998,000 observations about the survey conducted by the Stockoverflow website, it contains different kinds of variables either numerical or categorical. It contains missing values.
