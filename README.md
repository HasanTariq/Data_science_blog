# Write a Data Science Blog Post

This is one of the Udacity Data Science Nano-Degree project. The main objective of this project is encourage student to come up with 3 - 5 questions and perform analysis on any dataset of their choose. Student should apply what they learnt during the nano degree starting from exploring the data walking through cleaning and massaging the dataset until the analysing the data ans start answering the questions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

installing Jupyter:

Follow the link here https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

python libraries needed:
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib



### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

installing Jupyter:

Follow the link here https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

Once you installed it, open it and install the following library from within jupyter notebook:
```
%pip install pandas
%pip install seaborn
%pip install matplotlib
```

## Project Motivation
The following questions motivate me to do this project:

- What is the most used programming language among developers?
- Which programing language has a positive correlation with high career satisfaction?
- Which platform and IDE are highly popular among the developer ?

### File Descriptions

There are 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells & comments were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

survey_result_puplic.csv - This file contains 998,000 observations about the survey conducted by Stockoverflow website, it contains different kinds of variables either numerical or categorical. It contains missing values.


### Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.
